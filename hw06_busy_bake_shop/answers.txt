Does your program run the same way each time? Why?

    The code runs the same everytime minus what threads get in 
    line at which time. This is because everything is called at the same time 
    and the semaphores do not allow for 'volatile' behavior. 


Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this
 ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?

    No this does not ensure first priority, because there are race conditions 
    involved and there is not a priotity queue where threads can jump in front
    of one and other.
