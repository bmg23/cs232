1. How many bytes of RAM does the virtual machine have by default?
    
    1024 words of RAM but the amount of bytes per word is 
    not defined so the actual number of bytes can change.  

2. What are the registers that the virtual machine has?

    The registers are inside of the CPU class, they are just global variables 
    inside of the class that can be edited. 

3. What arguments does the instruction JLZ take and what does the instruction do?

    JLZ takes two arguments a register and destination, and will jump too the 
    destination if the values in the register is less then 0.   

4. When does the CPU check if an interrupt has occurred?

    Inside of the run program function there is an if statement 
    that checks if the interrupt variable has been set to true, 
    it then handels the interrupt if it is true.  

5. What does the Monitor instruction S do?

    S shows memory from start to end. 
    Can be used to show what is currently in memory.
    The way it is used is S <start address> <end address>, 
    then displays each address value and data.  

6. What does the Monitor instruction ! do?

    Changes the OS into debugging mode, is 
    off on start up. When debugging mode is
    toggled on, after each command the value of 
    pc, reg 0-2 are shown. 

7. Can assembly language files contain comments? How about blank lines?

    Yes and yes, comments are started with a #. And blank 
    lines do not matter, because it is being read like text files
    so any line starting with # is ignored and any blank line is skipped 
    over.

8. What function is called to write bytes into memory?

    mov can add values to memory, in assembly. You can write values 
    into RAM using the OS D command. 

9. Do assembly language programs assume they are loaded into memory at certain locations?

    No you have to tell the program where to go in memory. And you have to tell the OS 
    what location in memory to execute.
