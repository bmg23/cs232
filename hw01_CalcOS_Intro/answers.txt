1. How many bytes of RAM does the virtual machine have by default?
    
    1024 words of RAM but the amount of bytes per word is 
    not defined so the actual number of bytes can change.  

2. What are the registers that the virtual machine has?

    The registers are inside of the CPU class, they are just global variables 
    inside of the class that can be edited. 

3. What arguments does the instruction JLZ take and what does the instruction do?

    Assembly Language Instructions:
    mov <src> <dst>   move value from <src> to <dst>
    add <val> <dst>   add value to <dst>
    sub <val> <dst>   sub value from <dst>

    <src> and <dst> can be a register name, a <value>, or *<value>.
    *<src> means the contents of RAM at the address <src>.
    *<reg> means the contents of RAM at the location referenced by reg.
    You cannot move values from one RAM location to another.
    <value> can be given in decimal or hexidecimal.
    <val> can be a literal value or a register name.

    jmp <dst> means change pc to <dst>.
    jez <reg> <dst> means change pc to <dst> if register <reg> is 0.
    jnz <reg> <dst> means change pc to <dst> if register <reg> is not 0.
    jgz <reg> : > 0
    jlz <reg> : < 0

    end  means end the program

4. When does the CPU check if an interrupt has occurred?

    Inside of the run program function there is an if statement 
    that checks if the interrupt variable has been set to true, 
    it then handels the interrupt if it is true.  

5. What does the Monitor instruction S do?

    S <start> <end>: show memory from start to end
    Can be used to show what is currently in memory. 

6. What does the Monitor instruction ! do?

    Changes the OS into debugging mode, is 
    off on start up. 

7. Can assembly language files contain comments? How about blank lines?

    Yes and yes, comments are started with a #. And blank 
    lines do not matter. 

8. What function is called to write bytes into memory?

    mov can add values to memory. 

9. Do assembly language programs assume they are loaded into memory at certain locations?

    No you have to tell the program where to go in memory. And you have to tell the OS 
    what location in memory to execute.
